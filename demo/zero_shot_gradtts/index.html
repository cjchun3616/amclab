            <h1>Zero-Shot Multi Speaker Speech Synthesis</h1>
            <hr>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Speech synthesis refers to a technology that converts text into speech waveforms. With the de-velopment of deep learning, neural network-based speech synthesis technology is being re-searched in various fields, and the quality of synthesized speech has also been greatly improved. In particular, Grad-TTS, a speech synthesis model proposed based on the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), which shows high performance in various domains, generates high quality speech and supports multi-speaker speech synthesis. However, there is a disadvantage that speech synthesis for unseen speaker is not possible. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an effective Zero-Shot Multi-Speaker speech synthesis model by improving the Grad-TTS structure. The proposed method allows receiving speaker information from speech references using a pre-trained speaker recognition model. Additionally, by converting speaker information via information perturbation, the model can learn various speaker information other than the speakers held in the dataset. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we measured the objective performance indicators Speaker Encoder Cosine Similarity (SECS) and Mean Opin-ion Score (MOS). In order to evaluate the synthesis performance for both seen speaker and un-seen speaker scenarios, a comparison was conducted with Grad-TTS, SC-GlowTTS, and YourTTS. The results demonstrated not only excellent speech synthesis performance for seen speakers but also performance similar to the Zero-Shot Multi-Speaker speech synthesis model.</p>
